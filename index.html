      <h1>Hello :) I'm Claude Hu / 胡子扬</h1>

      <h2 class="section-title">Within Science</h2>
      <div class="section-frame">
        <p>
          I work as a scientific programmer in the <a href="https://databio.org/">Sheffield Lab of Computational Biology</a> at the University of Virginia. My work focuses on Python & Rust development, genomic representation learning, and biomedical metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to joining the Sheffield lab, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree with a double major in Computer Science and Neuroscience & Behavioral Biology from Emory University and a Master’s degree in Biostatistics from Duke University. At Emory, I worked for <a href="https://sociology.emory.edu/people/bios/Franzosi-Roberto.html">Dr. Roberto Franzosi</a>, contributing to his text analysis suite for social science scholars, which introduced me to linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). At Duke, under the guidance of <a href="https://biostat.duke.edu/profile/chuan-hong">Dr. Chuan Hong</a>, I contributed to collaborative projects involving biomedical NLP.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience in the Sheffield Lab exposed me to embedding models and multimodality. I am particularly interested in exploring their potential in areas I am passionate about, such as symbolic music and mental health.

      <h2 class="section-title">Out of Science</h2>
      <div class="section-frame">
        <p>
          I enjoy playing classical and acoustic guitar. My journey with guitar began at the Shenzhen Fuge Guitar Arts Center, where I was taught by its founder, Lijun Wang. I attended master classes with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Zhi_(guitarist)">Zhi Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yurylikhachev">Anna Likhacheva</a>. Prior to college, I actively performed both solo and in a classical guitar quartet, and later played both acoustic and electric guitar in my high school band. I particularly enjoy arrangements of existing music for solo guitar, such as <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_AJ5KCNAv8&list=PLKsMygTF4c45Kdb-ZchXpLOtjnu9WHgLl">Chansons Françaises</a></em> by Roland Dyens and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjOQ69JjTRo&t=1717s">Pictures at an Exhibition</a></em> by Kazuhito Yamashita.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of music, I am also passionate about sports. I have played several seasons in the <a href="https://www.socaspot.org/">co-ed soccer league in Charlottesville</a> as a goalkeeper and fullback. I also trained boxing at <a href="https://wartimefitnesswarriors.org/">Wartime Fitness Warriors</a> with amateur and professional fighters from June 2023 through January 2025.
